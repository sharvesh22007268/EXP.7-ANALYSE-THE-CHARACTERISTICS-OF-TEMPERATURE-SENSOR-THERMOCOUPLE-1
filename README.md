# EXP.7-ANALYSE-THE-CHARACTERISTICS-OF-TEMPERATURE-SENSOR-THERMOCOUPLE-1

## Aim:
To understand the working Principle of Thermocouple.

## Step by step Procedure:

1. Select the type of Thermocouple to be used for experimentation.

2. Select the 'Reference Temp' to set the temperature of reference junction from drop down menu.

3. Click on 'Get Temperature' green color box. The temperature will be displayed for which output (mV) is to be found.

4. Click on 'thermocouple Reference Table' link below the sketch to refer to standard thermocouple charts. From the perticular type of thermocouple chart, find the output millivolt value corresponding to the temperature. Enter it in the box provided and submit.

5. Enter the output millivolt in the answer box. If the answer is correct, it will get indicated in the box below the answer. If not verify it and enter correct output value.If wrong answer is submitted repeatedly for 3 times, the correct answer gets pop-up.

6. Go to step 3. Repeat the procedure at least for 3 times.

7. After finishing the required set of readings 'Plot', 'Next set' and 'Level 2' tabs are enabled. See the graph by clicking on 'Plot' tab.

8. By clicking Next set tab, Repeat the procedure for different types of Thermocouples at various reference temperature values.

9. Click on 'Plot' to see the graphs for comparative study.

10. Study the graphs for RTD performance with different reference resistance values and different materials.
When you click on 'Level 2' tab, you can verify the Dynamic response of the thermocouple.
